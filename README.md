# Flask OAuth2 Google Login Example
Provide a brief description of the project:

vbnet
Copy code
This is an example Flask application that demonstrates how to implement Google OAuth2 login using the Flask framework. It allows users to authenticate with their Google accounts and retrieve their email information.
Explain the purpose of the code and its functionality:

python
Copy code
## Code Functionality

This code sets up a Flask web application that enables users to log in using their Google accounts. It utilizes OAuth2 for the authentication process and retrieves the user's email information.

The application provides the following endpoints:

- `/`: Home endpoint that redirects to the Google sign-in page.
- `/home`: Redirect endpoint after successful login and consent from the user.
- `/user/<email>`: Landing page after successful login, displaying the user's email.

The code utilizes the `oauthlib` library for handling OAuth2 authentication and the `requests` library for making HTTP requests to the Google APIs.
Provide instructions on how to set up and run the application:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- oauthlib
- requests

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install flask oauthlib requests

less
Copy code

### Usage
1. Replace the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` variables in the code with your own Google API credentials. These credentials can be obtained by creating a project in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and enabling the Google OAuth2 API.

2. Run the Flask application:
python app.py

vbnet
Copy code

3. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:5001` to access the application.

### Notes
- This application uses a self-signed SSL certificate (`ssl_context='adhoc'`) for local development. If you encounter any SSL certificate errors, you can modify the `ssl_context` parameter in the `app.run()` method to use a valid SSL certificate.

- For a production environment, it is recommended to use a valid SSL certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

- This example focuses on the authentication process and does not cover user session management or database integration. In a real-world application, you would typically store the user's information in a database and manage user sessions securely.
Add any additional sections or information as needed, such as credits, acknowledgments, or license information.
